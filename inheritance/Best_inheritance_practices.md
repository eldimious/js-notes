# Prototype Inheritance + Concatenative Inheritance(cloning/mixing) + Function Factory

In this section we will try to combine the 3 ways of making inheritance in JS. So we will mix:

1. **Prototype Delegation**: best for shared methods, better in memory consumption

2. **Concatenative inheritance(mixins)**: best for saving states using Object.assign.

3. **Functional Inheritance**: best for encapsulating private data using closures.
