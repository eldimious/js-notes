 ## Javascript under the hood

 JavaScript unlike other programming languages, itâ€™s **single threaded**. That means, code execution will be done one at a time. Since code execution is done sequentially, any code that takes longer time to execute, will block anything that needs to be executed. Hence sometimes you see below screen while using Google Chrome.
